    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>In the mystery black box I believe there's a weighted contraption within the box that stops and releases the water.</p>
    <Evidence > </h1>
    <p>WE teasted the amounts of water that came out of the black box, We noticed as a class that differnt amounts of water was coming out everytime
.  The approach was looking inside/ trying to tilt the box to help us with our mode We as a group tried to figure out by doing these things but we didn't find a solution   </p>
  <h1> Reasoning1 <h1>
  <h2>Part one<h2>
    <p>Making a model could help us understand how the black box works and other hidden features it may have<p>
